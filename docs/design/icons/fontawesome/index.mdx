> Font Awesome is the Internet's icon library and toolkit, used by millions of designers, developers, and content creators.

Using icons in your documentation is a great way to add visual interest and help users understand the content. Font Awesome is a great icon library you can use in your documentation. This article shows you how to use Font Awesome icons in your Docusaurus documentation site.

<DocusaurusButton label="Docusaurus Documentation: MDX Component Scope" to="https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react#mdx-component-scope" />

To complete these steps you will need to have a custom MDXComponents file. If you don't have one, just create the file `MDXComponents.js` or `MDXComponents.tsx` in the `src/theme` directory of your project.

## Installing Font Awesome

Font Awesome is available for React as a series of Node Package Manager (NPM) packages. To install Font Awesome, run the following command, this installs the Font Awesome core, and the free solid icons:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
```

You can add the regular and brand icons by adding the following NPM packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
```

You can add the Pro versions of any Font Awesome packages by [configuring access to the Font Awesome NPM repository](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/packages.html#configure-access) and installing the appropriate packages (for example `@fortawesome/pro-solid-svg-icons`).

:::security[Protect your NPM token]
If you are using a private NPM repository, you should protect your NPM tokens.

If you're using `npm` you should use environment variables along with a `.npmrc` file to store your NPM token. For more information, see [alternate per project setup using environment variable (for NPM)](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/packages#alternate-per-project-setup-using-environment-variables).

If you're using `yarn` you should use environment variables along with a `.yarnrc.yml` file to store your NPM token. For more information, see [per-project setup for modern Yarn](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/packages#per-project-setup-for-modern-yarn).

## Using Font Awesome with Markdown or MDX

You can use Font Awesome icons in your Markdown or MDX files by exposing the `FontAwesomeIcon` component in `MDXComponents`. An example of this is below with added comments to aid understanding:

```jsx title="src/theme/MDXComponents.js"
import React from 'react';
// Import the original mapper
import MDXComponents from '@theme-original/MDXComponents';
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'; // Import the FontAwesomeIcon component.
import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core'; // Import the library component.
import { fab } from '@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons'; // Import all brands icons.
import { fas } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'; // Import all solid icons.

library.add(fab, fas); // Add all icons to the library so you can use them without importing them individually.

export default {
  // Re-use the default mapping
  ...MDXComponents,
  FAIcon: FontAwesomeIcon, // Make the FontAwesomeIcon component available in MDX as <icon />.
};
```

We can then use the `icon` component in MDX files:

```jsx title="docs/my-doc.mdx"
---
title: My Doc
---

<FAIcon icon="fa-brands fa-github" size="4x" /> This is a GitHub icon.
```

## Using Font Awesome with React

You can use Font Awesome icons in your React components by using the `FontAwesomeIcon` component. Font Awesome have fantastic [React documentation](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/react/) that you can use to learn more about using Font Awesome with React components.

If this is working you'll see a Font Awesome GitHub icon below:

<FAIcon icon='fa-brands fa-github' size='4x' />
