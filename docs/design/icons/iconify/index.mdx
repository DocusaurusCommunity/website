Using icons in your documentation is a great way to add visual interest and help users understand the content. Iconify is a great icon library you can use in your documentation. This article shows you how to use Iconify icons in your Docusaurus documentation site.

<DocusaurusButton label="Docusaurus Documentation: MDX Component Scope" to="https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react#mdx-component-scope" />

To complete these steps you will need to have a custom MDXComponents file. If you don't have one, just create the file `MDXComponents.js` or `MDXComponents.tsx` in the `src/theme` directory of your project.

## Installing Iconify

Iconify is available for React as a Node Package Manager (NPM) package. To install Iconify, run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @iconify/react
```

## Using Iconify with Markdown or MDX

You can use Iconify in your Markdown or MDX files by exposing the `Iconify` component in `MDXComponents`. An example of this is below with added comments to aid understanding:

```jsx title="src/theme/MDXComponents.js"
import React from 'react';
// Import the original mapper
import MDXComponents from '@theme-original/MDXComponents';
import { Icon } from '@iconify/react'; // Import the entire Iconify library.

export default {
  // Re-use the default mapping
  ...MDXComponents,
  IIcon: Icon, // Make the iconify Icon component available in MDX as <icon />.
};
```

We can then use the `icon` component in MDX files:

```jsx title="docs/my-doc.mdx"
---
title: My Doc
---

<IIcon icon="mdi:github" height="48" /> This is a GitHub icon.
```

Iconify have a superb [Icon Explorer](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) where you can search for icons and copy the code to use in your documentation.

## Using Iconify with React

You can use Iconify icons in your React components by using the `Icon` component. Iconify have wonderful [React documentation](https://docs.iconify.design/icon-components/react/) that you can use to learn more about using Iconify with React components.

If this is working you'll see an Iconify GitHub icon below:

<IIcon icon="mdi:github" height="48" />
