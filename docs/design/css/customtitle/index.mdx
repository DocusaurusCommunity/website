In your Docusaurus project, you may need to modify the design by editing the CSS. 
We will see how to target specific elements to spruce up our documentation.

## Custom your Hx tag 

If you add a style to your h2, for example, you would add this style for the entire website. Consequently, 
elements like the h2 tags of your DocCardList would also be affected, and this is not really what we want.

Here's a way to modify only the h2 tags of your documents, 
```css
.markdown h2 {
  padding: 35px;
  background-color: #1a8870;
  text-align: center;
}

.markdown .card h2 {
  padding: initial;
  background-color: initial;
  text-align: initial;
}
``` 

## Let's look at the result.

## To explain in detail

we have a div that wraps the section where our entire documentation is located. It has the class "markdown".

```html
<div class="theme-doc-markdown markdown" > </div>
```

So to select the h2 tags hierarchically under this class, we write:

```css
.markdown h2 {
  padding: 35px;
  background-color: #1a8870;
  text-align: center;
}
```

Finally, to ensure that other h2 tags under the markdown class are not all affected,
 we reassign the original CSS properties to the other elements that should not be modified

Par exemple, les titres des DocCardList 
```css

.markdown .card h2 {
  padding: initial;
  background-color: initial;
  text-align: initial;
}
``` 

Now you have some tips to further customize your documentation.
