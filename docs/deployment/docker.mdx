# Creating a Dockerfile

:::tip

This dockerfile is based on the work of [@BillChirico](https://github.com/BillChirico). Please check out his GitHub and that of [Volvox LLC](https://github.com/VolvoxLLC). We are very grateful for their contribution!

You should start by creating a `dockerfile` at the root of your repository. This file contains the instructions used to build your Docker image. The Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

## Approaches

There are two approaches to dockerizing a Docusaurus site:

1. Build the site in a container with the output sent to a docker volume and then use another container running a web server (like [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) or [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)) to serve the resulting static site.
1. Build the site in a container, 

```docker
# Use a larger node image to do the build for native deps (e.g., node, python)
FROM node:lts-alpine AS deps

WORKDIR /opt/app
# Copy package.json and any lockfiles to the working directory.
COPY package.json package-lock.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml ./
# Copy the rest of the files to the working directory in the container
COPY . /
# Run a CI 
RUN npm install

# Stage 2: Build the application
FROM node:lts-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /opt/app
# Copy all files from the current directory to the working directory in the container
COPY . .
# Copy node_modules from the "deps" stage
COPY --from=deps /opt/app/node_modules ./node_modules
# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Stage 3: Create the production image
FROM node:lts-alpine AS runner
# Set the working directory in the container to /opt/app
WORKDIR /opt/app
# Set environment variable
ENV NODE_ENV=production
# Copy necessary files from the "builder" stage
EXPOSE 5000
COPY --from=builder /opt/app/build ./build
COPY --from=builder /opt/app/docusaurus.config.ts .
COPY --from=builder /opt/app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
# Define the command to run the application
CMD npm run serve
```

With this Dockerfile, you are equipped to construct your Docker image efficiently, ensuring a lighter and more secure deployment.
