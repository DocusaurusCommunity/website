title: Definition Lists
description: Adding definition lists to your documentation.
---

[Definition lists](https://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html_lists_other.asp) are used to define terms and their corresponding definitions. They are useful for glossaries, FAQs, and other reference material.

We can add definition lists to our documentation by using the `dl` tag. Inside the `dl` tag, we can add `dt` tags for the term and `dd` tags for the definition.

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Term</dt>
  <dd>Definition</dd>
</dl>
```

However we don't like using HTML tags directly in our Markdown files. Luckily the excellent [remark plugin](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) ecosystem comes to the rescue. We can use the [remark-definition-list](https://github.com/wataru-chocola/remark-definition-list) plugin to add definition lists to our documentation.

First we need to install the plugin.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install remark-deflist
```

Then we can add the plugin to our `remark` plugins in our `docusaurus.config.js` file.

```js
import remarkDefList from 'remark-deflist';
...
presets: [
    [
        '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
        {
            docs: {
                remarkPlugins: [
                    remarkDefList,
                ],
            },
            blog: {
                remarkPlugins: [
                    remarkDefList,
                ],
            },
            pages: {
                remarkPlugins: [
                    remarkDefList,
                ],
            },
        },
    ],
],
```

Now we can add definition lists to our documentation.

```mdx
Apple
: Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in the family Rosaceae.

Orange
: The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
```

Which will render as:

Apple
: Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in the family Rosaceae.

Orange
: The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
